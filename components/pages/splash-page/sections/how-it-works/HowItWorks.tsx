        Honestly, we don&apos;t really know where we&apos;re going, but we have
        ideas.

        Like all democratic movements, we&apos;re starting with conversations
        and collaborations.

        Anything that gets done will need to be done by the community and formed
        organically. A backend developer, a frontend developer, and a designer
        all decide to split a freelance gig. It works, but they&apos;ve all made
        less money as a result, even if the process went smoother together than
        alone.

        At that point, they could reach out to a tech sales person within the
        community to see about bringing someone on board to generate leads and
        close deals for the trio. And with that, a tech coop is born.
      </PText>
      <PText>
        How that coop operates and functions is up to the members. Some projects
        might turn into products. Others into studios. Some might opt to open
        the ownership model to the users as well. There is no one way or right
        way to do this, other than together and by refusing to centralize the
        ownership.

        The Bootstrapper Guild will function as the background support network
        for any groups that decide to go for it and start their own
        cooperatives. At first, it&apos;ll be people coming together to offer
        advice and support. Eventually, we&apos;d like The Bootstrapper Guild to
        be able to offer operational support to coop startups.

        Who is this for? Anyone who wants to build together. Developers,
        marketers, recruiters, graphic designers, product managers, UI/UX
        designers, salespeople, anyone involved in tech who could bring
        something to a new company (even office managers and admins!).
